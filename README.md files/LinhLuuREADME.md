# Client Check-In 4: Linh Luu
    Our client wants us to create an application that acts as an interactive study tool for their students. After we receive more specific detail about the subject matter, we will create a mobile-friendly web page that holds informative guides for the students to reference. 

    In this check in, Linh is in charge of create an orginal html file named: indexNeely.html and neely.css file. In the html file i create the main page and the flip card template and add styles for flip-card and the main page. Also, i am in charge of style for the first 5 words: ability, absorb, access, accuse and act. 

    The indexNeely.html is later change to words.html and neely.css is later change to word.css to mmet a common name of the group.

    After i posted the template file on Github, other members help to adjust some styles to fit with a teacher's requirements.

    We communicate with each other via Microsoft Team and we using Visual Studio Code to pull and merge our file from Github.
