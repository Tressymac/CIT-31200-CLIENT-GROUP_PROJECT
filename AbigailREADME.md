Our group initially met on Wednesday at 1:30 to discuss theme, layout, and word division.
Individually, we created our cards. We are meeting again today (Friday) to merge files and submit. 
I created my five cards along with their definitions, example, and image. Then I created a branch on our Repo, and pushed my files to my branch.
